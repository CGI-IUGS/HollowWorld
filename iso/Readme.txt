The replica of the INSPIRE SVN at JRC 
   https://inspire-twg.jrc.it/svn/iso/
has been moved to 
   https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/mirrors/iso-harmonized-model/ 

This allows us to keep the repository synched automatically. 
You should reset your version control configuration to point to a checkout from the new location. 

Sorry if the move is inconvenient.
