The resources in this directory are intended to support the development of Application Schemas, using UML for design. 
This includes a selection of components from the ISO/TC 211 "Harmonized Model" as well as some other components from OGC and W3C. 
For projects developing Application Schemas that are intended to be compatible with ISO/OGC service and data frameworks, these should re-use (make reference to) components from the ISO packages in preference to representations of similar concepts in the other packages. 

Files are organised into stable releases - under "tags", the latest of which should be the starting point for users.

Development occurs under "trunk" which will be occasionally locked, which means that users will not necessarily be able to access copies - hence requirement to publish from trunk to the tags directory.
 
The primary resources are XMI representations of some "standard" UML models, suitable for use win developing application schemas. 

Instructions on use of these resources is provided in
