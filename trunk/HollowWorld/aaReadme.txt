The resources in this directory are intended to support the development of Application Schemas, using UML for design. 
This includes a selection of components from the ISO/TC 211 "Harmonized Model" as well as some other components from OGC and W3C. 
For projects developing Application Schemas that are intended to be compatible with ISO/OGC service and data frameworks, these should re-use (make reference to) components from the ISO packages in preference to representations of similar concepts in the other packages. 

The primary resource is the HollowWorldOM.EAP file, which is a UML template in "Enterprise Architect" format. 
Enterprise Architect is a UML modelling interface from Sparx Systems http://www.sparxsystems.com.au. 
A "read only" version of the software is available at no cost from http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/products/ea_downloads.html

Alternative versions of the model exported in XMI format that may be useful in other modelling environments are provided in the subdirectories. 

Instructions on use of these tools is provided in https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/twiki/bin/view/Xmml/UmlGml, https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/twiki/bin/view/Xmml/HollowWorld and https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/twiki/bin/view/Xmml/OandMCookbook.
